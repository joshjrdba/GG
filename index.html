    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-6">👤 About</h2>
    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto space-y-4">
      <p>I have 25 years of experience in architecture, construction, forensic architecture, and consulting. I also served in the U.S. Coast Guard — because I chose to save lives, not take them. I'm happily married with five children and now live in the Pacific Northwest, where I love the outdoors and find peace in nature’s beauty.</p>
      <p>Building Bozrah is biblically based. We believe in being prepared, like the ten virgins with oil in their lamps. We must build our sanctuaries while we wait for the return of the Messiah — strong, ready, and faithful.</p>
